        <h5 align="center">"As I wrote about the life of Doug Tompkins, I attempted to describe this book in a
narrative that my eleven-year-old daughter, Zoe, could understand. I sought to help her,
even at that young age, understand the concept of a legacy with dignity. I told Zoe that
Doug Tompkins—whom she’d heard quite a bit about during her dad’s four-year
journey—felt that a most noble goal in life was to leave the planet “a little bit better.”
She smiled, nodded, and then asked the kind of question so natural to a child and so
poignant for an adult: “Why only a little bit better?”" Jonathan Franklin, A Wild Idea</h5>

I looked at my watch, but Graham whispered to me that it was Erdös's way of asking, `When were you born?'"Paul Hoffman, The Man Who Loved Only Numbers (I really recomend reading this book! Erdos was a really unique gentle person)</h5>

        <h5 align="center"> “In 1908, in a wild and remote area of the North Caucasus, Leo Tolstoy, the greatest writer of the age, was the guest of a tribal chief “living far away from civilized life in the mountains.” Gathering his family and neighbors, the chief asked Tolstoy to tell stories about the famous men of history. Tolstoy told how he entertained the eager crowd for hours with tales of Alexander, Caesar, Frederick the Great, and Napoleon. When he was winding to a close, the chief stood and said, “But you have not told us a syllable about the greatest general and greatest ruler of the world. We want to know something about him. He was a hero. He spoke with a voice of thunder; he laughed like the sunrise and his deeds were strong as the rock….His name was Lincoln and the country in which he lived is called America, which is so far away that if a youth should journey to reach it he would be an old man when he arrived. Tell us of that man.” Doris Kearns Goodwin, Team of Rivals</h5>
